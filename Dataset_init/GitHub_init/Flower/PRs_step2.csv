https://github.com/adap/flower/pull/826	[]	Fixing script to work with Ray ^1.6.0 without mypy `--no-implicit-reexport` issues.	Fixing script to work with Ray ^1.6.0 without mypy `--no-implicit-reexport` issues.This took a long time. Ray changed the way it structures the internal imports. Now one should call directly the submodule `ray.worker` to access `get`.	1	True	2021-08-30 20:12:30	2021-09-01 07:41:46	2021-09-01 07:41:45
https://github.com/adap/flower/pull/748	[]	Adding sklearn logreg example	"Adding sklearn logreg exampleAdding a scikit-learn logistic regression example using MNIST dataset.
The openml helper in scikit-learn is broken, so I used the openml python library directly.
I tried to make this as simple as possible following the quickstart examples but it turned out little complicated since model initialisation and parameter setting is a not so obvious with scikit-learn.```suggestion
This example of Flower uses `scikit-learn`'s `LogisticRegression` model to train a federated learning system. It will help you understand how to adapt Flower for use with `scikit-learn`.

            # Ignore convergence failure due to low local epochs
``````suggestion
    Sets initial parameters as zeros
    Required for since model params are uninitialized until model.fit is called
    But server asks for initial parameters from clients at launch
    Refer to sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression documentation
    for more information.

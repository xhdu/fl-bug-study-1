https://github.com/adap/flower/issues/817	[]	Error: 'Sequential' object has no attribute 'set_weight'	"Error: 'Sequential' object has no attribute 'set_weight'So I am trying out Federated Learning on structured data and following this [dataset of German credit data](https://www.kaggle.com/kabure/german-credit-data-with-risk). I have a simple tensorflow based model and code. 

Here is my client class- 

```
class GCR_Client(fl.client.NumPyClient):
    def __init__(self, model, x_train, y_train, client_name):
        self.model = model
        self.x_train = x_train
        self.y_train = y_train
        self.client_name = client_name
    
    def get_parameters(self):
        return self.model.get_weights()
    
    def fit(self, parameters, config):
        self.model.set_weights(parameters)
        self.model.fit(self.x_train.values, self.y_train.values, epochs=15, batch_size=64)
        return self.model.get_weights(), len(self.x_train), {""Fit Data from"":self.client_name}
    
    def evaluate(self, parameters, config):
        self.model.set_weight(parameters)
        return 0,0,{""Clinet Evaluation"" : ""Undefined"", ""Client Name"":self.client_name}
```


In order to remove all the external factors I removed the code where I calculate the evaluation. 

Whenever I run the code with 1 server and multiple clients, I get error in the `def evaluate(self, parameters, config)` function. 
Error is `'Sequential' object has no attribute 'set_weight'`

`def fit(self, parameters, config):` method contains the same line but the error is only being generated from `evaluate` function only. I am not sure what's wrong with the code. @Samvid95 thanks for reaching out. Could it be the missing `s`?

- `self.model.set_weights(parameters)` in `fit`
- `self.model.set_weight(parameters)` in `evaluate`Hahaha I completely missed it. Thank you 

Now let me remove this question from the face of the internet. /s"	2	2021-08-17 04:58:41	2021-08-18 08:26:47	2021-08-18 08:26:47

It seems that it blocks in python threading. I tried also with different versions of python, the same result. What can be the problem?@sallogy can you share a bit more information about your runtime environment?

* Which OS (incl. version) e.g. Ubuntu 18.04
* Which CPU/GPU
* How much RAM

Also what code did you run? A specific Flower example? Did you bootstrap your own project without any example? Some context is very much appreciated.
Sorry, my mistake. When I dug into the source code, I realized that the default FedAvg strategy expects minimum 2 clients in order to start the training, and I tried with 1 client (actually I dockerized the client and server, and I thought that it is some issue related to this, but not). . Anyway, some informative message about the minimum number of clients required to start the training would be helpful.   @sallogy Happy to hear you could resolve the problem. Would you like to propose it as an idea here: https://github.com/adap/flower/discussions/categories/ideas and explain a little what you would consider a good solution? I would close this ticket for now as it's resolved."	3	2021-06-07 16:14:50	2021-06-11 07:35:00	2021-06-11 07:35:00
https://github.com/adap/flower/issues/712	[]	Using results returned from client's fit	"Using results returned from client's fitI want to save the results returned to the server by the client's fit method and save them. 
I am not sure how I am supposed to access the results in the server script.

The example in https://flower.dev/docs/saving-progress.html#aggregate-custom-evaluation-results only covers results from the clients evaluate function but does not show results from the client's fit function.

In the [advanced_tensorflow](https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/examples/advanced_tensorflow/client.py) example, the client's `fit` method is returning some results to the server, but the `server.py` is not using the these results anywhere. 

I could also do this if there was a way to access all the returned accuracies and results from the clients after the fl is finished.

is there an api reference of the returned result object ?Hi @cozek , thanks for the questions. What you want to do isn't properly documented yet (and there will be built-in improvements in future releases), but you could do it in the same way as it's done in the docs you linked above. The only difference is that you'd override `aggregate_fit` instead of `aggregate_evaluate`:

```python
class SaveCustomFitMetricStrategy(fl.server.strategy.FedAvg):
    def aggregate_fit(
        self,
        rnd: int,
        results: List[Tuple[ClientProxy, FitRes]],
        failures: List[BaseException],
    ) -> Optional[Weights]:
        """"""Aggregate evaluation losses using weighted average.""""""
        if not results:
            return None

        # Save results
        for _, fit_res in results:
            fit_metrics = fit_res.metrics
            print(""TODO: save individual results here"", fit_metrics)

        # Call aggregate_fit from base class (FedAvg)
        return super().aggregate_fit(rnd, results, failures)
```

The `results` object is a list of tuples (pairs of `(ClientProxy, FitRes)`), the code example above shows how to get the dictionary returned by `Client.fit` from `FitRes`. The `flwr.common.typing` module contains many type definitions (for future reference):

https://github.com/adap/flower/issues/659	[]	QFedAvg Loss Unitialized Error	"QFedAvg Loss Unitialized ErrorHello,
I am trying to use the qffedavg strategy and getting ""NameError: free variable 'loss' referenced before assignment in enclosing scope."" I think the problem is that I did not specify an evaluation function as a parameter so the loss variable is not initialized before it is called later in the program. If I understand right, then if the loss really is necessary for q-FedAvg the evaluation function parameter should not be optional. Otherwise, the for loop after the line where loss is supposed to be initialized (line 185) should first check that loss is not None.

Also, from the paper, I think the correct name of the algorithm is qFedAvg not qFFedAvg as the strategy is named here. 

Is there an example for the evaluation function?


Server code:
```

Hi @smoser82 , thanks a lot for the detailed report!

We do have an example for the evaluation function in the Advanced TensorFlow Example (https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/advanced_tensorflow, and a few more in deprecated parts of the codebase under `src/py/flwr_example` and `src/py/flwr_experimental`, but those will be removed eventually).

The gist is to hand a function to the strategy that takes model parameters and return the evaluation result:

```python
def main() -> None:
    # Create strategy
    strategy = fl.server.strategy.FedAvg(
        fraction_fit=0.3,
        fraction_eval=0.2,
        min_fit_clients=3,
        min_eval_clients=2,
        min_available_clients=10,
        eval_fn=get_eval_fn(),
        on_fit_config_fn=fit_config,
        on_evaluate_config_fn=evaluate_config,
    )
    # Start Flower server for four rounds of federated learning
    fl.server.start_server(""[::]:8080"", config={""num_rounds"": 4}, strategy=strategy)


def get_eval_fn():
    """"""Return an evaluation function for server-side evaluation.""""""

    # Load data and model here to avoid the overhead of doing it in `evaluate` itself
    (x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

    # Use the last 5k training examples as a validation set
    x_val, y_val = x_train[45000:50000], y_train[45000:50000]

    # Load and compile model
    model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(
        input_shape=(32, 32, 3), weights=None, classes=10
    )
    model.compile(""adam"", ""sparse_categorical_crossentropy"", metrics=[""accuracy""])

    # The `evaluate` function will be called after every round
    def evaluate(weights: fl.common.Weights) -> Optional[Tuple[float, float]]:
        model.set_weights(weights)  # Update model with the latest parameters
        loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_val, y_val)
        return loss, accuracy

    return evaluate
```

Does this solve your issue?

I'll take a look at the paper and talk to the original author of this strategy to learn more about the naming and the issue with the optional nature of the evaluation function.That's a very helpful example, thank you. I think it's working now!The renaming just got merged into `main` and will become available in tomorrow's Flower nightly release (and the full 0.17 a little later) - thanks again for pointing this out @smoser82 !

Hi @Martin-Stevlik , can you try to use IPv6 (so `[::]:8080`) for both server and client? We've recently changed the example code to use this because IPv4 produced an error in some cases.Thank you for your quick response. I have tried it and it works just fine. Is there a way for it to work with IPv4 in future? Because I want to run the server.py in AZURE VM and most of VM does not support IPv6 ...Great to hear it works @Martin-Stevlik - IPv4 is generally supported, but we're seeing the error you reported every now and then, however, it's not quite clear where it's coming from. Which platform are you on? We've tested the examples with both IPv4 and IPv6 and some people experienced issues while others didn't.

In the case of Docker, it's actually recommended to use IPv4 over IPv6 (IPv6 requires additional configuration in Docker).I am using Windows 10 and as a virtual environment Anaconda. My next step is to try your embedded devices quickstart on my Raspberry PI's. I will see how it goes there...@Martin-Stevlik were you able to resolve your issue? Let us know if we can help you further. With regards to Flower on Raspberry this might be useful for you: https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded_devices


Hi, I followed your instructions in the embedded devices tutorial and came across the same connecting issue. I have a PC witch runs server.py and 2 raspberries that runs client.py. Both raspberries and PC are on the same network and I am using your latest release 0.14.0. I don't know if you should put the port number in the client's code, but I have tried it but it would not resolve an issue.

@Martin-Stevlik I think the issue is that the clients also need the port of the server. Can you try with `192.168.1.32:5000` when calling the `run_pi.sh`?

If that's the issue I will adjust the https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/examples/embedded_devices/README.md file to clarify it further.@tanertopal as you can see on the right side of the image. I have already tried it and it did not work ... I will try using IPv6 and give you an update on how it goes. @Martin-Stevlik my bad. Missed that. Am I guessing right that the server is running on a Windows machine? I think we did not test the setup with a Windows OS. I'll try it out in the next couple days on Windows 10 if you can confirm my guess.

In general can you tell me a little bit about your overall setup?

- Which exact OS and version
- Version of the tools involved e.g. DockerI am using 64 bit OS, Windows 10 PRO version 2004. For the environment on PC, I am using an anaconda with python=3.8.3, flwr=0.14.0, tensorflow-cpu=2.4.1 

As for raspberries I have raspberry 3 model B, OS is 64bit Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS with docker version 20.10.4@tanertopal so I have tried it with IPv6 and the same issue comes up. I have put ""[::]:5040"" in server.py and my IPv6 address in client.py, if I do this in quickstart_tensorflow project it works ...@Martin-Stevlik so I assume you have run the `quickstart_tensorflow` example without docker as otherwise, you would have to activate [IPv6 support in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/)? I am going to set up a new Raspberry Pi and try to replicate your issue. Need to check if I have a Raspberry 3 B somewhere lying around (I think so 😄  ).

As another idea. Are you already part of our [Slack community](https://flower.dev/join-slack)? Maybe we can solve your issue faster there.

A few more ideas/questions:
1. Is the IP of the server you are using visible when you run `Get-NetIPConfiguration` in Powershell on the Windows server?
2. Can you modify the `run_pi.sh` and `run_jetson.sh` to include `--net=host`
    * `docker run --rm flower_client ${@}` => `docker run --net=host --rm flower_client ${@}` 
3. What happens when you run `telnet SERVER_ADDRESS SERVER_PORT` on the Raspberry Pi? Does it connect? You can cancel the connection if so using CTRL+D. This will give us a hint if its a Docker issue.Okay, so the key advice for running this ""embedded_devices"" project on windows 10 is to fully disable the firewall ;) "	13	2021-02-23 11:39:53	2021-03-18 19:49:45	2021-03-18 19:49:45

https://github.com/adap/flower/issues/540	['bug']	Evaluation of the final model on empty client set	"Evaluation of the final model on empty client setHello,
I'm trying to run the basic [Tensorflow Example](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/quickstart_tensorflow) but when the [final model evaluation is executed](https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/42ef63b6a8097c3b571b65e11b5471477253a48d/src/py/flwr/server/app.py#L97) the client returns an empty set, thus the evaluation is not executed.
This should be due to the fact that the server [closes the connections](https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/42ef63b6a8097c3b571b65e11b5471477253a48d/src/py/flwr/server/server.py#L117) with the clients after the fit.

Thanks for the report @altor ! We went through your code and everything looks fine. The issues seems to be related to parameter serialization for distributed evaluation (i.e., on the clients). Does the initial round of training work before Flower tries to do the evaluation?
IIRC there were no changes related to that part of the codebase during the 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 release. Would it be possible to open source your code (or alternatively invite @tanertopal  and @danieljanes  to a private repo) so that we can try to run it?Closing this now because we couldn't reproduce. Feel free to reopen if this is still an issue for you @altor ."	2	2020-12-09 18:39:19	2021-02-05 10:10:08	2021-02-05 10:10:07
https://github.com/adap/flower/issues/408	['bug']	execution of client example crash after training is terminated	"execution of client example crash after training is terminatedHello !

I'm trying to use the example you provide ([quickstart](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/src/py/flwr_example/quickstart) and [tensorflow](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/src/py/flwr_example/tensorflow)). I achieve to train models but clients can't achieve to stop themselves without crashing.

I just run `run_server.sh` and `run_clients.sh` in separate terminals, see the clients downloading data and train their models. After training, the server evaluate the model ant stop itself properly.
At this moments, clients crash by rising an exception with this message :

 Hi @altor - thanks for creating the issue! We are aware of this, the reason for this exception is that the current `Client`/`KerasClient` implementations do not implement a *graceful shutdown* when the server is done training. We'll soon release an update that fixes the issue :) until we do, if the server shows the final accuracy/loss logs, your workload ran successfully.Ok, For the moment, i'll just catch the exception and close the client properly
Thanks for your answer !We'll update this issue once the change has landed.Thanks !
PR is ready: #449 PR is merged, graceful shutdown is available on branch main. New release will follow shortly.thanks !@altor the new release 0.10.0 is now available on PyPI"	8	2020-09-29 13:11:20	2020-11-09 11:28:22	2020-11-09 11:28:22
